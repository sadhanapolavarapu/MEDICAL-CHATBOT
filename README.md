# MEDICAL-CHATBOT
MEDICAL CHATBOT
Medical Chatbot Using Generative AI
This project involves the development of a medical chatbot designed to provide accurate health-related responses using advanced generative AI techniques.

Key Features:
BioMistral 7B LLM: Leveraged this model from Hugging Face for precise and contextually relevant medical responses.
Efficient Search and Retrieval: Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for quick retrieval from a Chroma vector store, using embeddings generated by the PubMedBERT model.
Data Processing Pipeline: Utilized the LangChain framework, integrating Llama LLM and Sentence Transformer models, to analyze and extract insights from the HealthyHeart PDF.
Technologies Used:
Python
Hugging Face (for the BioMistral 7B and PubMedBERT models)
LangChain (for pipeline integration)
Chroma (as the vector store)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (for search and retrieval)
Llama LLM and Sentence Transformers (for data processing)
(Streamlit (for the user interface)#optional )
